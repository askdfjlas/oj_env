be careful when copying codes
be careful when transforming: what is changing?
edge cases (end or start)
order of divide and multiply
are the conditions enough?
when iterating, previous affect follows?
think about greedy carefully, like direction
try other possibilities
iterate different things
ABABABAB => A BABABA B
messing row and column
no handling input
perform order
add mod before minus
i-=2 and i=-2
precalculation
maximum range
overflow
init segment tree backward
there are may be 2+ bugs
break the group
net cost makes any difference?
read carefully (data range)
