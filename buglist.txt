be careful when copying codes
be careful when transforming: what is changing?
edge cases
order of divide and multiply
direction of greedy
are the conditions enough?
when iterating, previous affect follows?
think about greedy carefully
try other possibilities
iterate different things
ABABABAB => A BABABA B
messing map and unordered_map
messing row and column
no handling input
edge cases on the end of the array
messing type
perform order
add mod before minus
i-=2 and i=-2
precalculation
maximum range
overflow
